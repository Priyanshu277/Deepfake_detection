# Deepfake Detection and Profanity Filtering Solution

## 🚀 Overview
With the rise of AI-generated deepfake videos, detecting manipulated content has become crucial for maintaining digital authenticity. Our solution leverages advanced machine learning models to detect deepfake videos and censor profane language in video audio. 

## 🎯 Features
- **Deepfake Detection:** Identifies AI-manipulated videos using XceptionNet.
- **Profanity Detection & Removal:** Scans video audio and censors inappropriate language.
- **Human Deepfake Identification Game:** Educates users on the difficulty of detecting deepfakes.
- **User-Friendly Prototype:** Includes a video & audio uploader for testing.

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Django, PostgreSQL
- **AI Models:** XceptionNet, AV-Hubert, CNN, Random Forest Classifier
- **NLP:** Speech-to-Text API for profanity filtering
- **Game Engine:** JavaScript

## 🔥 Future Enhancements
- Real-time deepfake detection for live streams
- Blockchain-based video authenticity verification
- Crowdsourced deepfake reporting system
